The gif app!!!
basics of how this is going to work
we are going to start with three buttons on the page and search bar
there will also be a header displaying a message so the user will understand how to interact. 
first thing needed is the API key from gif site.API Application programming interface. 
we will be using the access gained from the api to pull and display a list of ten gifs. (GIFs are fun little animated photos aka small videos.)
the user can begin to click on the pre-exisiting buttons to see the ten gifs stored in the array pulled by API. 
A for loop will be used to run throught the array and display jquery will be used to display the images, (<img>) created dynamically, by that I mean I will use jquery to create the image tag to store the gif from the array from the api and append  this to the page.
or the user will be able to use key words to search the API database and create a new button, (this button will be created dynamically and labeled how the user searched.)
if there is anytime left I will attempt to make a fav section. 
1. lay out html and link js file to it!
2. obtain API key and link to js file.
3. check the object information in the console. to make the connection is established. 
4. in the js file. you need name some variables.
var - images
var - rating
var - topics
creat an empty array [];
use a for loop to pass the gifs from the array and 
use jquery to diplay imges ratings
dynamically creat button for topics. 
use jquery to display all images.
